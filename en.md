## The journey of modernizing HCL Domino

After more than two decades building enterprise solutions on the Lotus Notes/Domino platform, the time has come to take the next step: modernize without abandoning what works.

This blog documents our real-world journey of building a modern application using **Spring Boot** and **Vaadin**, integrated with **HCL Domino** through the **Domino REST API (DRAPI)**. This is not a rewrite from scratch, but an architectural evolution that respects the existing investment in data, business rules, and — most importantly — the robust security model that Domino provides.

### What you will find here

- **Authentication and authorization** based on HCL Domino's security infrastructure, using LDAP and JWT tokens generated by DRAPI
- **Practical integrations** between Spring Boot and Domino REST API, including access to documents, views, and agents
- **UI development** with Vaadin Flow, connecting Java components directly to the backend
- **Real-world challenges** of migrating a corporate ERP with multiple integrated modules
- **Brazilian tax compliance** preserved during the transition (NFe, ICMS, PIS/COFINS, and other obligations)

### Who is this for

If you manage, develop, or maintain HCL Domino applications and are evaluating modernization paths, this space is for you. We share every discovery, every obstacle, and every solution we find along the way, with the goal of contributing to the community facing similar challenges.

The approach is simple: we learn something new, we publish it here. That way, knowledge is not confined to a single project — it becomes accessible to everyone on the same journey.
