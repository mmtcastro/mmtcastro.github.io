*This is an English version of the blog's introductory content, for the benefit of the international HCL Domino community.*

## From Lotus Notes to Modern Java

After more than two decades building enterprise solutions on the Lotus Notes/Domino platform, the time has come to take the next step: modernize without abandoning what works.

This blog documents our real-world journey of building a modern application using **Spring Boot** and **Vaadin**, integrated with **HCL Domino** through the **Domino REST API (DRAPI)**. This is not a rewrite from scratch, but an architectural evolution that respects the existing investment in data, business rules, and — most importantly — the robust security model that Domino provides.

## What we are building

Over the years, we developed a full-featured corporate ERP on Domino/Notes with modules covering sales (CRM), purchasing, finance, inventory, services, HR, and business intelligence. Thousands of documents, hundreds of views, dozens of agents, and a solid foundation of business rules that support daily operations.

The decision to modernize does not mean discarding what was built. On the contrary: it means evolving the architecture to current technologies while preserving data, processes, and the proven security infrastructure.

## The modernization stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| **Backend** | Java 17+, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security |
| **Frontend** | Vaadin Flow (server-side Java components) |
| **Integration** | HCL Domino REST API (DRAPI) |
| **Authentication** | LDAP (Domino Directory) + JWT (DRAPI tokens) |
| **Authorization** | ACL based on the HCL Domino security model |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL |

## What you will find here

- **Authentication and authorization** based on HCL Domino's security infrastructure, using LDAP and JWT tokens generated by DRAPI
- **Practical integrations** between Spring Boot and Domino REST API, including access to documents, views, and agents
- **UI development** with Vaadin Flow, connecting Java components directly to the backend
- **Real-world challenges** of migrating a corporate ERP with multiple integrated modules
- **Brazilian tax compliance** preserved during the transition (NFe, ICMS, PIS/COFINS, and other obligations)

## Who is this for

If you manage, develop, or maintain HCL Domino applications and are evaluating modernization paths, this space is for you. We share every discovery, every obstacle, and every solution we find along the way, with the goal of contributing to the community facing similar challenges.

The approach is simple: we learn something new, we publish it here. That way, knowledge is not confined to a single project — it becomes accessible to everyone on the same journey.

## Why share

The HCL Domino community is active, but documentation on integration with modern Java frameworks is still scarce. Every discovery we make — whether it is configuring JWT authentication via DRAPI, mapping Domino views to JPA queries, or reproducing the ACL model in Spring Security — represents hours of research and experimentation.

By publishing these findings, we hope to:

- **Reduce the learning curve** for those on the same path
- **Create a practical reference** for Domino + Spring Boot + Vaadin integration
- **Encourage discussion** about modernization strategies within the community
